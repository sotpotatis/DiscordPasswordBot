'''Discord Police Bot
The Discord Police Bot is a really simple bot that allows one to lock a server.
It requires you to press a button and enter a message to earn a role.

Hosted invite link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=863082773379416115&scope=bot&permissions=339078238
You can revoke admin access from the bot, however, make sure that it still is allowed to delete messages, and that it can see all the channels
that you want it to see, and that it has permissions to delete messages and award roles.
